# Indoor-Localization
These codes have been written for the Indoor Localization datasets problem and utilize SVM and KNN machine learning techniques. 
The purpose is to attempt to predict the correct coordinate positions of objects. 
While this project is not well-polished, it serves as a basic example of using machine learning techniques.
